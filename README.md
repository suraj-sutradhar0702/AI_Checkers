## Introduction

**AI_Checkers** is a Checkers game built using Python's Pygame library for the graphical user interface. It integrates an AI opponent that uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to make strategic decisions. This project is designed to offer an engaging experience for players of all levels.

## Features

- **Play Against AI**: Challenge an AI opponent with advanced decision-making capabilities.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface built with Pygame.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Efficient search algorithm to enhance AI performance.
- **Game History**: Keep track of game moves and history.
- **Adjustable AI Difficulty Levels**: Customize the difficulty of the AI opponent.

## How It Works

The AI_Checkers game leverages the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for its AI opponent. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. **Game Setup**: The game initializes with a standard 8x8 Checkers board setup.
2. **Player Moves**: Players can make moves using the Pygame GUI, which updates the board state.
3. **AI Moves**: The AI evaluates potential moves using Alpha-Beta Pruning, optimizing its decisions to challenge the player.
4. **Game End**: The game continues until a win or draw condition is met, with appropriate messages displayed.

For a detailed explanation of the AI algorithm and game logic, refer to the algo and game_logic files in the project.

## Levels

The game includes adjustable AI difficulty levels. The `level` variable can be modified before running play_checkers.py to set the AI's difficulty. Changing `level` variable increases the depth (number of moves which the program tries to explore) for searching the best possible move.
